## [01 - What is FMCW Radar and why is it useful?](https://youtu.be/xUGWHGjCtII)

This video goes over range estimation with FMCW radar and gives a little insight into why you might want to use it over a traditional pulsed radar. 

There are many more trade-offs between the two that I don't discuss here, but this should give you a basic understanding of the technology. 

I'll use this as a basis for future videos on FMCW radar. There is a ton to cover and I'm excited to dive into those animations and explanations!

## [02 - How do you build an FMCW Radar?](https://youtu.be/MlcydOwmRIY)

Have you ever looked at an FMCW radar block diagram and had no idea what the components do? 

In this video I attempt to clear this up a bit by going through a simplified block diagram and explaining the components, step-by-step. The video then takes a short detour into the digital domain where I briefly touch on the expansive world of radar signal processing. In this case I literally only go into any depth about the FFT, but I mention some of the other very exciting places DSP can take you! 

There are so many other applications and implementations of FMCW radar that this video could not possibly cover, so take all this information with a grain of salt and hopefully you'll go on to explore it further.
